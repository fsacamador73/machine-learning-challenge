# Machine Learning - Exoplanet Exploration

## Conclsuions

### Selected model: Model 3
It is observed that by including the most of the features that represent the outcome the accuracy of the model increases.
It goes from the lowest in Model 2 of 0.51 to Model 3 of 0.81
It is also observed that the score in the different analysis in Model 3 is consistent for test data.
No significant change in SVC accuracy is observed unsing other model such as: rbf or sigmoid. Poly otherwise, shows a deterioration up to 0.59.

### My model
This model is stable for train and test data as the results shown tp predict if the features collected will lead to a confirmed Exoplanet.
I better understanding of the variables would help to select those are the most important for an Exoplanet as well as to find which groups of features combinations have the most weights that leads to the most accurate outcome.

## Neuronal Network
### Selected Model: Model 4
I ran also the analysis using neuronal networks, taking as base the features used in Model 3.
I ran the analysis twice varying the amount of hidden layers but not significant change is observed between both analysis.
It is relevent to mention that the accurary increased using this method up to 0.89

## Comparison Table
### I attached an Excel File where the comparisons between the different models analyzed are shown.
